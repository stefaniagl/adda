Default input (parameter) files needed in some operational modes of ADDA. If using these modes, copy the corresponding files to the execution directory. Most of these files can be modified by user to fit specific needs.

* `alldir_params.dat` – parameters of calculation of some integral scattering quantities, incurring integration over the scattering angle
* `avg_params.dat` – parameters of averaging over particle orientation
* `scat_params.dat` – parameters of grid of scattering angles, at which the scattering fields are calculated
