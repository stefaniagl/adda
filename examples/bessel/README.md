This python code "bb_examples" represents the comparison of scattering intensities calculated with DDA (ADDA code) for the scattering of Bessel beam of 2 options by choice.
    
* `option_1/` - contains raw ADDA results (log file, mueller matrix, incident field, and cross sections by default) for the 1st command line option.
* `option_2/` - contains raw ADDA results (log file, mueller matrix, incident field, and cross sections by default) for the 2nd command line option.

* The results of the following script are saved in `saved/` as PDF files.
