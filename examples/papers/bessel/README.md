This python code "bb_paper_2022" represents the comparison of scattering
intensities calculated with GLMT (reference data) and DDA (with ADDA) for the
scattering of Bessel beam (CS type) by a sphere (option 0) and coated sphere
(option 1).

Reference data were kindly provided by Zhuyang Chen (DOI:10.1088/2040-8978/16/5/055701).
