This python module "bb_module.py" includes functions for the representation of figures 12-15 from the article with the following python scripts:

   * fig12_sphere.py
   * fig13_coated_sphere.py
   * fig14_extrapolation.py
   * fig15_cube.py
    
* `dda/` - contains raw ADDA results (log file, mueller matrix, and cross sections by default) in `dda/option_...` folders (0 - fig12; 1 - fig13; 2-4 - fig15).
  * `dda/extrapolation/` - contains several "run_..." folders with raw ADDA results for the extrapolation presented in fig14.

* `ref/glmt/` - contains raw data for the scattering intensities of Bessel beams obtained with the generalized Lorenz-Mie theory (glmt) for fig 12 and fig 13 (/option_0 and /option_1 respectively).

* `particles/` - contains images of scattering particles presented in fig 12,13,and 15.

* The results of the following scripts are saved in `saved/` as PDF files.
